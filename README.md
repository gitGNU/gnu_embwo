#0.- What the hell is it?

I'm trying to organize all the reports I have at my new work.
So... with BWO we can take a .md file with a job report about a client, it's computers, work description, etc. and put it together with old reports in a database!

If I want to get briefings, info, reports from a client I can take them back from the database.

#1.- What I need to test/develop... it?

I'm simply coding using pyqt5, python3 and sqlite3, get them installed by your package manager and happy hacking!
